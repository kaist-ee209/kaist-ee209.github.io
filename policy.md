<h1> Lectures and Precepts </h1>

<p>
Lecture attendance is mandatory. You are responsible for
the materials presented in the lecture and precepts. Some of the
content is not in the textbook.

Students are expected to regularly check the course webpage, class schedule updates, lecture notes, programming assignments and other related course materials. <!-- <b>Please refer to logistics (Lecture #1) and <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G915469DF/feed">Campuswire</a> for more detailed information such as contribution rules, grading systems, and all other regulations for this class</b> -->

<h3> Receiving help from others </h3>

Programming is an individual creative process much like
composition. You must reach your own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with
other people are permitted and encouraged. However, when the time
comes to write code that solves the problem, such discussions (except
with course staff members) are no longer appropriate: the code must be
your own work. If you have a question about how to use some feature of
C, Unix, etc., you certainly can ask your friends or the teaching
assistants, but specific questions about code you have written must be
treated more carefully.

<p>
For each assignment you must specifically state, in your readme file,
the names of any individuals from whom you received help, and the
nature of the help that you received. That includes help from friends,
classmates, lab TAs, course staff members, etc.

</p><p>
Do not, <i>under any circumstances</i>, copy another person's
code. Incorporating someone else's code into your code in any form is
a violation of academic regulations. This includes adapting solutions
or partial solutions to assignments from any offering of this course
or any other course. There is one exception to the code-sharing rule:
You may adapt code from the EE 209 course materials provided that you
explain what code you use, and cite its source in your readme file.

</p><p>
Copying and transforming someone else's code (by rearranging
independent code, renaming variables, rewording comments, etc.) is
<span style=" font: bold; color:red;">plagiarism</span>. Some inexperienced programmers have the
misconception that detecting such plagiarism is difficult. Actually,
detecting such plagiarism is quite easy. Not only does such plagiarism
quickly identify itself during the grading process, but also we can
(and do) use software packages, such as Alex Aiken's renowned MOSS
software, for automated help.

</p><p>
If a student is confirmed to commit plagiarism on an assignment, then
the standard penalty is <span style=" font: bold; color:red;">automatic failure (F)</span> of the EE 209
course.

</p><h3> Providing help to others </h3>
<p>
Abetting plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration by "sharing" your
code is prohibited. Sharing code in digital form is an especially
egregious violation. Do not e-mail your code or make your code
available to anyone. Do not share your code with anyone even after the
due date/time of the assignment.

</p><p>
You are responsible for keeping your solutions to the EE 209
programming assignments away from prying eyes. If someone else copies
your code, we have no way to determine who is the owner and who is the
copier. If you are working on a public lab computer, make sure
that you do not leave the computer unattended, and that you delete
your local files and logout before leaving.

You should store all of your assignment files in a private
directory. You can create a private directory using commands similar
to these:

</p><p>
</p><pre class="ui message">
mkdir ee209
chmod 700 ee209
</pre>


<h3> Exam Conduct</h3>

If we find a student commits inappropriate conduct during an in-class exam, the standard penalty is
<span style=" font: bold; color:red;">automatic failure (F)</span> of the EE 209 course.
