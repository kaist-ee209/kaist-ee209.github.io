<h2 class="ui center aligned header">Assignment 0: Drawing a Rectangle</h2>

<h4 class="ui center aligned header" id="timer">&nbsp;</h4>
</div>

<h2 class="ui dividing header">Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn or review (1)
the fundamentals of the C programming language, (2) how to use the
GNU/Unix programming tools,
especially <code>bash</code>, <code>vscode</code> (or any editor of your choice),
and <code>gcc209</code>.</p>


<h2 class="ui dividing header">Rules</h2>

<p>Make sure you study the
course <em><a href="../../policy">policy</a></em> web page
before doing this assignment or any of the EE209 assignments. In
particular, note that you may consult with the course instructors, lab
TAs, mailing list, etc. while doing assignments, as prescribed by that web
page.

<!--h3>Background</h3>

<p> <code>wc</code> is a word counting program. Given an input

<p>The C preprocessor is an important part of the C programming
system. Given a C source code file, the C preprocessor performs three
jobs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Merge "physical" lines of source code into "logical" lines. That
is, when the preprocessor detects a line that ends with the backslash
character, it merges that physical line with the next physical line to
form one logical line.</li>

<li>Remove comments from ("de-comment") the source code.</li>

<li>Handle preprocessor directives
(<code>#define</code>, <code>#include</code>, etc.) that reside in the
source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The de-comment job is substantial. For example, the C preprocessor
must be sensitive to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fact that a comment is a token delimiter. After removing a
comment, the C preprocessor must make sure that a <b>white space
character</b> is in its place.</li>

<li>Line numbers. After removing a comment, the C
preprocessor <b>sometimes must insert blank lines in its place</b> to
preserve the original line numbering.</li>

<li>String and character constant boundaries. The preprocessor must
not consider the character sequence (<code>/*...*/</code>) to be a
comment if it occurs inside a string constant (<code>"..."</code>) or
character constant (<code>'...'</code>).</li>
</ul>

<hr-->

<h2 class="ui dividing header">The Task</h2>

<p>Your task is to write a simple C program named <code>rect</code> that
  prints a rectangle whose height and width are given via input.

<h2 class="ui dividing header" >Functionality</h2>

<p>Your program should read two integer from the input, 
  and print the rectangle whose height and width are corresponding to the input integers.
A typical execution of your program from a shell might look like
this:</p>

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ ./rect
2 2
+--+
|  |
|  |
+--+</pre>
</div>

<p>If you want input from a text file:

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ ./rect &lt; somefile.txt
+--+
|  |
|  |
+--+</pre>
</div>



In the output, <code>+</code> indicates the vertex, and <code>-</code> and <code>|</code> represent the side of the rectangle.

<p> Here are a few rules.

<ul>
  <li> The syntax of comment follows that of the C language (C99).
  <li> Please follow the input and output format. The incorrect format may result in deducting points.
  <li> The limit of height and width is 30.
</ul>

<p> Belows are the examples of <code>rect</code>.

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ ./rect
1 1
+-+
| |
+-+
</pre>
</div>

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ ./rect
3 2
+--+
|  |
|  |
|  |
+--+
</pre>
</div>

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ ./rect
3 4
+----+
|    |
|    |
|    |
+----+
</pre>
</div>

<h2 class="ui dividing header">Logistics</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Create Source Code</h3>

<p>Use any editor (e.g., <code>vscode</code>) to create source code in a file named <code>rect.c</code> that print a rectangle.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Preprocess, Compile, Assemble, and Link</h3>

<p>Use the <code>gcc209</code> command to preprocess, compile, assemble, and link your program. Perform each step individually, and examine the intermediate results to the extent possible.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Execute</h3>

<p>Execute your program multiple times on various input files that test all logical paths through your code.</p>

<p>We have provided several files that you require for this assignment.
</p>

<p style="">(1) Download <a href="./assignment0.tar.gz">a tar.gz file</a>to your directory.
  You will find <code>samplerect</code>, test files, and several utilities.

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ wget https://ee209.kaist.ac.kr/assignments/assignment0/assignment0.tar.gz
$ mkdir assignment0
$ mv assignment0.tar.gz assignment0
$ cd assignment0
$ tar -zxf assignment0.tar.gz
</pre>
</div>

<p style="">(2) <code>samplerect</code> is an executable version of a correct assignment solution. Your program should write <em>exactly</em> (character for character) the same data to the standard output stream and the standard error stream as <code>samplerect</code> does. You should test your program using commands similar to these:</p>

<div class="ui message" style=""><pre>$ ./samplerect &lt; <em>somefile</em>.txt &gt; output1 2&gt; errors1
$ ./rect &lt; <em>somefile</em>.txt &gt; output2 2&gt; errors2
$ diff output1 output2
$ diff errors1 errors2
$ rm output1 output2 errors1 errors2</pre>
</div>

<p style="">The Unix <code>diff</code> command finds
differences between two given files. <code>diff output1
output2</code> produces output, then <code>samplerect</code> and your
program have written different characters to the standard output
stream.</p>

<!--<p style="margin-left:2em;">(3) <code>testdecomment</code> and <code>testdecommentdiff</code> are bash scripts that automate the testing process. Comments at the beginning of those files describe how to use them. After copying the scripts to your project directory, you may need to execute the commands <code>chmod 700 testdecomment</code> and <code>chmod 700 testdecommentdiff</code> to give them "executable" permissions.</p> -->


<p>You also can test your program against its own source code using a command sequence such as this:</p>

<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ ./samplerect &lt; sample00.txt &gt; output1 2&gt; errors2
$ ./rect &lt; sample00.txt &gt; output2 2&gt; errors2
$ diff output1 output2
$ diff errors1 errors2
$ rm output1 output2 errors1 errors2</pre>
</div>

<h3>Step 4: Create a <code>readme</code> File and an Ethics document</h3>

<p>Use an editor to create a text file named <code>readme</code> <b>(not <code>readme.txt</code>, or <code>README</code>, or <code>Readme</code>, etc.)</b> that contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name, student ID, and the assignment number.</li>

<li>A description of whatever help (if any) you received from others while doing the assignment, and the names of any individuals with whom you collaborated, as prescribed by the course policy web page.</li>

<li>(Optionally) An indication of how much time you spent doing the assignment.</li>

<li>(Optionally) Your assessment of the assignment: Did it help you to learn? What did it help you to learn? Do you have any suggestions for improvement? Etc.</li>

<li>(Optionally) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. In particular you should describe all known bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Descriptions of your code should not be in the <code>readme</code> file. Instead they should be integrated into your code as comments.</p>

<p>Your <code>readme</code> file should be a plain text file. Don't create your <code>readme</code> file using Microsoft Word, Hangul (HWP) or any other word processor.</p>



<p>For <b>every</b> assignment submission, you <b>must</b> submit your
own Ethics document that pledges that you did not violate
any rules of <a href="../../policy"> course policy</a> or any rules of
ethics enforced by KAIST while doing this assignment. </p>

<p> Please edit an <a href="../EthicsOath.docx">Ethics
document</a> for assignment 0 and submit it along with other
files. Please write the assignment number, your name, sign on it, and
make it into a PDF file (you can convert it into the PDF format in the
FILE menu of MS Word). </p>

<h3><a name="submission"></a>Step 5: Submit</h3>

<p> Your submission should include your <code>rect.c</code> file and your <code>readme</code> file.

<p>
Create a local directory named '<code>YourID_assign0</code>' and place all your files in it. Then, <code>tar</code> your submission file by issuing the following command on a lab machine (assuming your ID is 20221234):</p>


<div class="ui message">
<pre>$ mkdir 20221234_assign0
$ mv rect.c readme EthicsOath.pdf 20221234_assign0
$ cd 20221234_assign0
$ tar -zcf 20221234_assign0.tar.gz *</pre>
</div>


<p>
Upload your submission file (20221234_assign0.tar.gz) to our KLMS assignment submission link. We do not accept e-mail submission (unless KLMS is down).

<p> Please follow the same procedure for the future assignments. <!--b>Do not archive your submission file without creating a directory and moving your files inside.</b--></p>

<p>Your submission file should look like this: </p>
<div class="ui segment">

<h2 class="ui dividing header">Grading</h2>

<div class="ui message error">
If your submission file does not contain the expected files,
or your code cannot be compiled at <code>eelabg12</code> with <code>gcc209</code>, we cannot give you any points. Please double check before you submit.
</div>
<p>We will grade your work on two kinds of quality: quality from <em>the user's</em> point of view, and quality from <em>the programmer's</em> point of view. To encourage good coding practices, we will deduct points if <code>gcc209</code> generates warning messages.</p>

<p>From the user's point of view, a program has quality if it behaves as it should. The correct behavior of your program is defined by the previous sections of this assignment specification.</p>

<p>From the programmer's point of view, a program has quality if it is well styled and thereby easy to maintain. In part, style is defined by the rules given in <em>The Practice of Programming</em> (Kernighan and Pike), as summarized by the <a href="../../style.pdf">Rules of Programming Style</a> document. For this assignment we will pay particular attention to rules 1-24. These additional rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Names</strong>: You should use a clear and consistent style for variable and function names. One example of such a style is to prefix each variable name with characters that indicate its type. For example, the prefix <code>c</code> might indicate that the variable is of type <code>char</code>, <code>i</code> might indicate <code>int</code>, <code>pc</code> might mean <code>char*</code>, <code>ui</code> might mean <code>unsigned int</code>, etc. But it is fine to use another style -- a style that does not include the type of a variable in its name -- as long as the result is a clear and readable program.</li>

<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Each source code file should begin with a comment that includes your name, student id, and the description of the file.</li>

<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Each function -- especially the <code>main</code> function -- should begin with a comment that describes <em>what the function does</em> from the point of view of the caller. (The comment should not describe <em>how the function works</em>.) It should do so by <em>explicitly</em> referring to the function's parameters and return value. The comment also should state what, if anything, the function reads from the standard input stream or any other stream, and what, if anything, the function writes to the standard output stream, the standard error stream, or any other stream. Finally, the function's comment should state which global variables the function uses or affects. In short, a function's comments should describe the flow of data into and out of the function.</li>

<li><strong>Line lengths</strong>: Limit line lengths in your source code to 72 characters.
Doing so allows us to print your work in two columns, thus saving paper.
You don't have to count the line length to meet the limit strictly, but it is encouraged to follow the rule.</li>
</ul>

<div class="ui message warning">
Please note that you might not get a full credit even if you pass the test with given test case. TAs might use another test cases to test functionality and robustness of your implementation.
</div>
<h2 class="ui dividing header">Special Note</h2>

<p>As prescribed by Kernighan and Pike style rule 25, generally you should avoid using global variables. Instead all communication of data into and out of a function should occur via the function's parameters and its return value. You should use ordinary <em>call-by-value</em> parameters to communicate data from a calling function to your function. You should use your function's return value to communicate data from your function back to its calling function. You should use <em>call-by-reference</em> parameters to communicate additional data from your function back to its calling function, or as bi-directional channels of communication.</p>

<p>However, call-by-reference involves using pointer variables, which we have not discussed yet. So for this assignment you may use global variables instead of call-by-reference parameters. (But we encourage you to use call-by-reference parameters.)</p>

<p>In short, you should use ordinary call-by-value function parameters and function return values in your program as appropriate. But you need not use call-by-reference parameters; instead you may use global variables. In subsequent assignments you should use global variables only when there is a good reason to do so.</p>
