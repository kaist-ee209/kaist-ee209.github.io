You must reach your own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with other people are permitted and encouraged. However, when the time comes to write code that solves the problem, such discussions (except with course staff members) are no longer appropriate: the code must be your own work. If you have a question about how to use some feature of C, Unix, etc., you certainly can ask your friends or the teaching assistants, but specific questions about code you have written must be treated more carefully.</p> <p> For each assignment you must specifically state, in your readme file, the names of any individuals from whom you received help, and the nature of the help that you received. That includes help from friends, classmates, lab TAs, course staff members, etc. </p> <p> Do not, <i>under any circumstances</i>, copy another person's code. Incorporating someone else's code into your code in any form is a violation of academic regulations. This includes adapting solutions or partial solutions to assignments from any offering of this course or any other course. There is one exception to the code-sharing rule: You may adapt code from the EE 209 course materials provided that you explain what code you use, and cite its source in your readme file. </p> <p> Copying and transforming someone else's code (by rearranging independent code, renaming variables, rewording comments, etc.) is <span style=" font: bold; color:red;">plagiarism</span>. Some inexperienced programmers have the misconception that detecting such plagiarism is difficult. Actually, detecting such plagiarism is quite easy. Not only does such plagiarism quickly identify itself during the grading process, but also we can (and do) use software packages, such as Alex Aiken's renowned MOSS software, for automated help. </p> <p> If a student is confirmed to commit plagiarism on an assignment, then the standard penalty is <span style=" font: bold; color:red;">automatic failure (F)</span> of the EE 209 course. </p> <h3> Providing help to others </h3> <p> Abetting plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration by "sharing" your code is prohibited. Sharing code in digital form is an especially egregious violation. Do not e-mail your code or make your code available to anyone. Do not share your code with anyone even after the due date/time of the assignment. </p> <p> You are responsible for keeping your solutions to the EE 209 programming assignments away from prying eyes. If someone else copies your code, we have no way to determine who is the owner and who is the copier. If you are working on a public lab computer, make sure that you do not leave the computer unattended, and that you delete your local files and logout before leaving. You should store all of your assignment files in a private directory. You can create a private directory using commands similar to these: </p> <p> </p><pre class="ui message">
mkdir ee209
chmod 700 ee209
</pre><h3> Manual Grading of the assignments </h3> <p>Once submitted no algorithmic change to the code is allowed and you cannot propose any changes to the submitted code.</p> <h3> Exam Conduct</h3> <p>If we find a student commits inappropriate conduct during an in-class exam, the standard penalty is <span style=" font: bold; color:red;">automatic failure (F)</span> of the EE 209 course.</p> <p><br /> <br /></p> </div> </article> </div> </main> </body> </html>
